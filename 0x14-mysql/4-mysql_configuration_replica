# MySQL Database Server Configuration File
#
# This file contains configuration settings for the MySQL database server.
# You can copy this file to one of the following locations:
# - "/etc/mysql/my.cnf" to set global options,
# - "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.
# You can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run the program with "--help" to get a list of available options and with
# "--print-defaults" to see which options it would actually understand and use.
#
# For detailed explanations of configuration options, refer to:
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/server-system-variables.html

# This setting will be applied to all MySQL clients.
# It's recommended to enclose passwords in ticks/quotes, especially if they contain "#" characters.
# Remember to update /etc/mysql/debian.cnf when changing the socket location.

# Configuration settings for specific MySQL programs.
# The following values assume you have at least 32MB of RAM.

[mysqld_safe]
socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
nice = 0

[mysqld]
#
# * Basic Settings
#
user = mysql
pid-file = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
port = 3306

#
# By default, MySQL listens only on localhost, which is more compatible and secure.
# To change this, uncomment the following line:
# bind-address = 127.0.0.1
#
# * Fine Tuning
#
key_buffer_size = 16M
max_allowed_packet = 16M
thread_stack = 192K
thread_cache_size = 8
myisam-recover-options = BACKUP
# max_connections = 100
# table_cache = 64
# thread_concurrency = 10
#
# * Query Cache Configuration
#
query_cache_limit = 1M
query_cache_size = 16M
#
# * Logging and Replication
#
# Both logs are rotated by the cron job.
# Be cautious, as general logs can negatively impact performance.
# As of MySQL 5.1, you can enable the log at runtime:
# general_log_file = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log
# general_log = 1
#
# Error log - expect very few entries.
#
relay-log = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.log
log_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log
#
# Here you can view queries with long duration:
# log_slow_queries = /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
# long_query_time = 2
# log-queries-not-using-indexes
#
# The following can be used for easy-to-replay backup logs or for replication.
# If setting up a replication slave, see README.Debian for other settings you may need to change.

log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
expire_logs_days = 10

binlog_do_db = tyrell_corp
# binlog_ignore_db = include_database_name
#
# * InnoDB
#
# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB data file in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Refer to the manual for additional InnoDB-related options.
#
# * Security Features
#
# Refer to the manual if you want to use chroot!
# chroot = /var/lib/mysql/

# For generating SSL certificates, consider using the OpenSSL GUI "tinyca."
