echo "PID    Program         Port"

# Iterate through each listening socket using ss command
ss -tln | awk '/LISTEN/ {split($6, a, ":"); printf "%-7s%-16s%s\n", $7, $NF, a[length(a)]}'

# Explanation:
# - The `ss -tln` command lists listening TCP sockets.
# - The `awk` command processes the output and extracts the PID, program name, and port.
# - The `split` function is used to extract the port number from the socket address.
